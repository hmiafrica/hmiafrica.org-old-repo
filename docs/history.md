NOTE for Nick (remove when done):

BTW the `.md` file format stands for "markdown". It would probably be worth your time to read up a little on how to use Markdown. The short explanation is that it's a way of marking up text for formatting it. For example, if you wrap a word in two asterisks characters, like this `**a word**` it will render as **a word** when processed.

You can read up on [using Markdown syntax here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). (In fact I used Markdown to make that text link) :wink:.

Pretty much every place that GitHub lets you enter text lets you use Markdown formatting. In fact, GitHub actually supports a few extra features, which we call "GitHub Flavored Markdown".
